You need to use exactly solc 0.8.15 (not the latest 0.8.16) and unfortunately not use `slither .` but more like `slither src/auction/` (paths are not resolving correctly)

Please don't spam the contest thread with something that it's well written, if you have a question about i++ or if require is better than custom errors use #❓questions or #🌳everything-evm  threads

[09/07/2022 3:29 PM] Franfran#5067
custom errors because usually they require strings which are dynamic (probably)

Sry for unclear question.
I had ask for audit company when I submitted for audit, if they can audit the deployment script and setup. They said yes.
Is that verifying deployment out of scope?

Hello dear friends
It could be ridiculous though, but the "forge install" is not being executed in my terminal
Could you please help me to solve this?


[09/09/2022 7:16 AM] matin6517
Another question is if I want to run the whole project inside Remix, which is the very base contract for that?


[09/09/2022 8:20 AM] rvierdiiev
and have you already installed it?

Is the expectation that you will deploy the implementations and users will just use the Manager to go through the proxy deployment flow? Or are you imagining that users will fork the whole thing and deploy the implementations on their own?

{Reactions}
chefskiss 

[09/13/2022 4:49 PM] tbtstl
The former, we'll deploy the implementation so users just need to deploy the proxies

Is there a list of Target Deployment Chains?
Mostly to check WETH return as WETH never returns false on mainnet


[09/17/2022 12:36 AM] Franfran#5067
Because if we would check for that and revert the Auction could be DOS

At least in my understanding
